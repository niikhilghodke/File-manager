# File-manager
This is my College project, an Android Application which will list all types of files available on your phone.
It also lists out all the audios and the user is able to play them all.
The app is in alpha stage and has some bugs in it.

The app is able to search for a particular word in all the .txt files in your phone and display the
file names and the number of occurences of the searched phrase.

But this just wroks for .txt file, i want to develop a app which can search through all types of files like
PDF and Docx. i have already implemented he PDF search whose code can be seen in PDF folder, but it has not been integrated into the app.
The code will be inetgrated after i finish the implementation of docx files.
